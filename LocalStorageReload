To ensure the countdown continues even after the page is reloaded, you need to persist the timer state (remaining time, running status, and paused status) in local storage and restore it when the page loads. Your code already has the necessary logic to save and load the timer state, but there might be a few adjustments needed to ensure it works seamlessly.

Hereâ€™s how you can fix it:

1. Ensure Timer State is Saved Correctly
The localStorage is already being updated in the startCountdown and togglePause functions. Make sure these updates are happening correctly.
2. Load Timer State on Page Load
The loadTimerState function is already implemented, but ensure it is called when the page loads.
3. Start the Timer Automatically if Needed
If the timer was running when the page was reloaded, it should automatically resume. This logic is already in the loadTimerState function.
4. Fix Potential Issues
Ensure the timeRemaining value is correctly parsed from localStorage and that the timer starts if it was running before the reload.

Explanation of the JavaScript Code
  1) Array of Quotes:
      - We create an array called quotes that contains a list of quotes. Each quote is a string.
  
  2) Function to Generate a Random Quote:
      - We define a function called generateRandomQuote.
      - Inside this function, we calculate a random index using Math.random() and Math.floor(). This gives us a random integer between 0 and the length of the quotes array minus one.
      - We then use this random index to select a quote from the quotes array.
      - Finally, we update the text content of the HTML element with the ID quote to display the selected quote.
  
  3) Event Listener:
      - We add an event listener to the button with the ID new-quote. When the button is clicked, it calls the generateRandomQuote function.
  
  4) Initial Quote Generation:
      - We call generateRandomQuote() once when the page loads to display an initial quote.
